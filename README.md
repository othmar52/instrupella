# instruâ˜»pella
DJ-like web application for playing acapellas to synth jam sessions  
It's similar to traktor or serato but with very limited functionality  

## GOAL
having another "instrument" next to dozens of synthesizers, drum machines, etc. that can only play acapellas/vocal samples. it should be very easy to perform in perfect sync without paying too much attention to it. 

## why not use any existing DJ app?
After trying dozens of dj apps i did not find any that met my requirements
 - play/perform acapella tracks or parts of it perfectly in sync to any music
 - useable on touchscreen/iPad (i do have timcode vinyl but its really an overhead for such a dummy task)
 - precise control for pitching
 - precise control for nudging
 - no need for multiple decks because the syncing is against live performed music
 - managing collection with tempo and beatgrid / downbeat

  - [ ] metronome sound is very quiet on iPad when track is playing - do we need a separate audio context? (not reproduceable in desktop browsers)
  - [ ] drop BeatGridPlugin as soon as new version of wavesurfer is released
  - [ ] add like / dislike to tracks with persisting
  - [ ] move github link to "about" modal to avoid leaving instrupella by accident
  - [ ] ensure player current time gets updated when seeking on wave-overview during stop

## low prio TODO
  - [ ] drag event on **track overview** for immediate seek during drag
  - [ ] add some kind of delay when swiping **big wave** instead of quick stop
  - [ ] improve playback during wave swipe (change playbackRate and length according to swipe move to get vinyl like sound)
  - [ ] choose from several metronome sounds
  - [ ] optional enter url for loading on deck
  - [x] fix `.pitch-control: { overflow:hidden; }` hack
  - [ ] optional choose local file for loading on deck
